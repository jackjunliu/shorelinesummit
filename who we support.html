            <h5>Channel Islands National Park Service</h5>
            
			<p>Channel Islands National Park encompasses five remarkable islands and their ocean environment, preserving and protecting a wealth of natural and cultural resources. Isolation over thousands of years has created unique animals, plants, and archeological resources found nowhere else on earth and helped preserve a place where visitors can experience coastal southern California as it once thousands of years ago.</p>

			<p>Close to the California mainland, yet worlds apart, the Channel Islands National Park Service exclusively manages four of the eight California Channel Islands (Anacapa, San Miguel, Santa Barbara and Santa Rosa) as well as their ocean environment committed to preserving and protecting a wealth of natural and cultural resources. Santa Cruz Island, the largest in the Channel Islands chain, is jointly managed by the Channel Islands National Park Service and the Nature Conservancy, another group Shoreline Summit Adventures supports. The park bridges two bio-geographical provinces nearly 2,500 miles of the North American coast. The Channel Islands are home to over 2,000 plant and animal species including 145 found nowhere else in the world. Archeological and cultural resources span a period of more than 13,000 years of Native American human habitation.</p>

			<p>The protection of these fragile island resources was ensured when Congress, in the act that created Channel Islands National Park in 1980, established a long-term ecological monitoring program to gather information on the current health of resources and predict future conditions.</p>

			<p>The islands were set aside by Congress not only to preserve these resources, but also to provide for your enjoyment. If you visit the park, you will be one of a very select group. Few people actually see this park because it is only accessible by boat or plane. As a result, the park is one of the least visited of all of America's national parks. The relatively light visitation enhances the islands’ feeling of solitude and assists in the protection of fragile resources.</p>

			<p>Shoreline Summit Adventures offers many ways to experience the enchantment of the Channel Islands ranging from land and sea activities to artist workshops. We wish to thank the Channel Islands National Park Service for their fine stewardship of the islands and are happy to support their efforts.</p>

		  	<h5>The Nature Conservancy</h5>
		  </div>

			<p>Shoreline Summit Adventures is proud to support the Nature Conservancy</p>
		  
		  	<p>The Nature Conservancy, founded in 1951, is the leading conservation organization working around the world to protect ecologically important lands and waters for nature and people. They address the most pressing conservation threats at the largest scale. Thanks to the support of more than 1 million members, they’ve built a tremendous record of success including:</p>
		  
		  	<div class="col-md-10">
		  		<ul>
					<li>Protection of more than 119 million acres of land and thousands of miles of rivers worldwide</li>
					<li>Operate more than 100 marine conservation projects globally</li>
					<li>Work in all 50 states and more than 35 countries protecting habitats from grasslands to coral reefs from Australia to Alaska to Zambia</li>
					<li>Address threats to conservation involving climate change, fresh water, oceans and conservation lands.</li>
		  		</ul>
		  	</div>
		  
		 	<p>The Nature Conservancy’s activities are rooted in good science aided by our hundreds of staff scientists. They pursue non-confrontational, pragmatic solutions to conservation challenges. Additionally, the Nature Conservancy partners with indigenous communities, businesses, governments, multilateral institutions and other non-profits. That is why they have the support of more than 1 million members who enable them to continue working on a scale that matters and implement solutions that endure. The California Program has protected hundreds of parcels of land and waterways: nearly 1.5 million acres of spectacular California landscape, as well as 3.8 million acres of sea floor—natural habitats essential to the survival of all species, including us.</p>

		  	<h5>The Nature Conservancy and the Santa Cruz Island Project</h5>
		  </div>

		 	<p>Twenty-five miles off the coast of southern California is Santa Cruz Island, the largest of California’s eight Channel Islands. More than 1,000 species of plants and animals inhabit the island’s high peaks, deep canyons, pastoral valleys and 77 miles of dramatic coastline. Once on the brink of ecological collapse, Santa Cruz Island now offers visitors a glimpse of what southern California used to be like thousands of years ago.</p>

			<p>After more than 30 years of tireless work, Santa Cruz Island has emerged as a leading example for successful island restoration and innovative conservation. Today, the Conservancy and its partners are focused on preserving the island’s unique plants and animals and sharing lessons learned in island restoration with other island conservation projects around the world.</p>

			<p>The Conservancy worked with its partners including the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Fish and Game to engage in an intensive, science-based restoration program to save the island fox and revitalize the natural communities of Santa Cruz Island. As part of this effort, bald eagle chicks were reintroduced and carefully raised and released into the wild. Bald eagles now reside and nest successfully on the island, for the first time in over half a century. The Conservancy’s efforts to restore the fox population, beginning in 2002, have been heralded as one of the fastest and most successful endangered species recovery programs in the country. More than 1,200 foxes now live in the wild, up from fewer than 100 when the restoration efforts began. For the first time in over 150 years, the island is free of non-native animals and native species are flourishing.</p>

			<p>Santa Cruz Island has more than 650 vascular plant species (75% of which are native), over 200 species of birds, 8 species of reptiles and amphibians, 7 mammal species (3 of which are bats) and 12 species found nowhere else on earth.</p>

			<p>Shoreline Summit Adventures thanks the Nature Conservancy for their fine stewardship of the islands and are happy to support their efforts.</p>

		  	<h5>Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary</h5>
		  </div>
		  
			<p>Shoreline Summit Adventures is proud to support the National Marine Sanctuary.</p>
		  
		 	<p>Through education, conservation, science, and stewardship, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary provides protection to its extraordinary natural and cultural resources so that nature can thrive, historic shipwrecks and artifacts remain respectfully in place, cultural connections remain strong, and careful public use and enjoyment can be sustained. Designated in 1980 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the sanctuary spans 1,470 square miles (or 1,110 square nautical miles) surrounding five of the eight Channel Islands: Anacapa, San Miguel, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa.</p>

			<p>The sanctuary’s remote, isolated position at the confluence of two major ocean currents creates remarkable biodiversity. The mingling of cool, nutrient-rich waters from the north with warm currents from the south form a dynamic transition zone that is home to a myriad of sea life from microscopic plankton to blue whales. The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary is responsible for the protection and preservation of submerged remains of the past that occupy the bottomlands of the sanctuary. Cultural and historic submerged sites include archaeological remains of shipwrecks and prehistoric land sites. The waters surrounding the Channel Islands provide a window into past cultures. Located at the islands are the remains of perhaps the earliest island inhabitants, the Chumash Indians, dating back 13,000 years. Sanctuary stewardship responsibilities include a mandate to inventory sites, encourage research, provide public education and oversee responsible visitor use.</p>

			<p>Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary uses a comprehensive ecosystem- based management approach is used to promote long term conservation of sanctuary waters, wildlife, habitats and cultural resources while allowing compatible human uses including fishing boating and many other kinds of outdoor tourism.</p>

			<p>Shoreline Summit Adventures thanks the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary for their fine stewardship of the islands and are happy to support their efforts.</p>
