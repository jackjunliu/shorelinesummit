			<h5>Tim Hauf</h5>
			<p>Growing up on a grain farm and the wide-open prairies of North Dakota gave Tim Hauf an appreciation of the outdoors and nature. His wanderlust started when he was two years old, often wandering across cow pastures accompanied only by his dog. He would go home with lots of stories about what he had found. In later years, he started taking photos of where he had been and of what he had experienced so he could “show and tell” others of his experiences.</p>

			<p>After graduating from North Dakota State University with a degree in business, Tim moved to California and found work as a financial analyst. With the outdoors beckoning, Tim left that career path and moved to Ventura County in the late 1970s. He found himself working as a ranch foreman which gave him enough time to take up photography. Tim has been honing his skills ever since.</p>
