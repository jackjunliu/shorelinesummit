			<h5>Bill Mitchell</h5>
			<p>Painting ‘en plein air’ is French for ‘in the open air’ and refers to painting outdoors. Inspired by French and early-California landscape painters, Bill began painting in this manner with oils in 1970. Many things have come and gone in his life but painting remained a constant. Bill has painted in many different parts of the world and to this day is astonished at the endless variety of subjects, light and weather effects. In his art, he is not overly concerned with literal representation of a subject as much as the feeling and spirit of a specific time and place.</p>

			<h5>John Iwerks</h5>
			<p>John’s love for landscape painting is rooted in the knowledge of geologic processes that have formed the landscape we live upon. Those large forces of shifting tectonic plates, particularly the interactions between the Pacific Plate and North America Plate forming the San Andreas Fault, are of extreme interest to John as he interprets the landscapes he paints.</p>

			<p>John is a member of the Oak Group, a group of painters dedicated to preserving the natural environment and works with conservation groups to make sure open spaces are available to future generations. John has been proud to contribute 50% of the sales of his work in our group exhibits towards environmental protection organizations. These include the Land Trust for Santa Barbara County, the Environmental Defense Center, the Trust for Public Land, the Nature Conservancy, Marin Agricultural Land Trust and many others. Many successes have occurred in Santa Barbara County including the Douglas Family Preserve, Sperling Preserve and the Arroyo Hondo Preserve.</p>

			<p>Cartooning and Animation have been a natural part of John's life which allows him to bring a sense of humor into t-shirt designs, illustration work and ceramic sculptures. He has a family background involved with the Walt Disney Studios to thank for this inspiration.</p>

			<p>John considers himself honored to share his life with his gifted artistic wife Chris Chapman. They share many painting adventures together including their time as preserve managers from 2001-2005 on the Arroyo Hondo Preserve for the Land Trust for Santa Barbara County. There John and Chris were able to combine their love of nature, painting and interpretation with like-minded visitors, volunteers and professionals at the preserve.</p>
