          <p>California scuba diving in the kelp forests around the Channel Islands is a unique and different experience for divers more accustomed to tropical waters. Diving in kelp is similar to a walk in a lush forest of trees with these plants growing to heights of more than 120 feet. Giant kelp helps support this rare aquatic ecosystem, providing an underwater environment with more than 800 species of marine life.</p>
          
          	<p>The knowledgeable crew provides many scuba diving opportunities to discover a wide variety of underwater landscapes. There are untold opportunities for viewing and photographing a panorama of underwater vistas.</p>

		  	<p>Unlike the coral reefs of tropical waters, the giant kelp forests of the Channel Islands add a third dimension. The rocks are covered with brightly colored bouquets of anemones, starfish and garlands of hydrocoral, sponges and sea fans. Moray eels, octopus, abalone, rock scallops, California spiny lobsters and a host of other sea creatures inhabit rock fissures and crevices. Divers may chance upon giant black sea bass weighing as much as 500 pounds or halibut, lingcod, vermilion rockfish, calico bass, bat rays and more. Friendly seals and sea lions pay visits to divers to show off their graceful swimming abilities. Migrating gray whales, blue whales, hump back whales and schools of dolphin are familiar sightings during daylight channel crossings.</p>
		  
          <p>Each island offers a different and unique collection of sea life so even the most discriminating diver can find a variety that will keep them entertained.</p>
          
		  <h5>Getting to Your Diving Destination</h5>
		  
		  <p>On most multi-day liveaboard dive trips, departures tend to leave during the night hours to arrive at the dive site first thing in the morning. The specific island location will dictate departure times.</p>
          
          <p>Boats are always open the night before departure so there's plenty of time to board the vessel, sign the ship's manifest, store equipment and settle into a comfortable bunk with the diveâ€™s own sleeping bag. In the early morning, when the engines of the boat come to life, divers may remain in bed or awake to watch the boat maneuver out of the Santa Barbara Harbor on the way to the dive destination.</p>
          
          <h5>Water Temperatures and Visibility</h5>
		  
		  <p>Water temperature can vary up to 15 degrees from the Northern and Southern ends of the island chain with an average of 50-60 (F) in winter and 60-70 (F) in summer. Visibility can range from 40 to 100 feet and, on rare occasions, up to 150 feet.</p>
          
          <h5>Underwater Photography</h5>
		  
		  <p>The boats were built with both the diver and photographer in mind. These camera gear friendly boats include a host of amenities for the photographer; camera tables, rinse tanks, lines at all exits to help lower your gear into the water and a friendly crew to help divers in and out of the water.</p>
          
          <p>From the majestically lit kelp forests and coral banks to colorful nudibranchs and playful sea lions, the Channel Islands are an underwater delight for creating beautiful imagery. Rich in diversity, the terrain can change from island to island ensuring no two visual experiences are the same.</p>
          
          <p>Much of the surrounding waters of the islands are protected by the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. As a result, they offer some of the most visually distinct animal and plant life in the world making it one of the best diving destinations to create stunning photography and captivating video.</p>
          
          <p>Amateur and professional photographers can be confident their gear will be well cared for and safe.</p>
          
          <h5>Underwater Fishing</h5>
		  
		  <p>Fishing at the Channel Islands can be very exciting and rewarding. Over the years, divers have come from all around to spearfish both on scuba and free diving, grab lobsters and take rock scallops. All dive boats firmly believe in observing all fish and game regulations and endorse responsible, conservative fishing practices. There is nothing like eating fresh seafood harvested from the ocean and everyone is encouraged part in conservation in order to sustain a healthy supply of marine life.</p>
          
          <p>Over the years, the Department of Fish and Wildlife along with groups made up of commercial and recreational fisherman, citizens and marine biologists established Marine Protected Areas (MPA's) around the Channel Islands National Park and National Marine Sanctuary. While these areas are no fishing zones, they are open for diving.</p>
          
          <p>Everyone who desires to fish must possess a California Fish and Wildlife license along with appropriate stamps and report cards. These licenses can be purchased online at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's website or at the dive boat office prior to your departure.</p>
