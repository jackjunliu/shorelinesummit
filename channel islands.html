			<p>Home to more than 2,000 species of animal, marine and plants, 145 found nowhere else in the world, Channel Islands National Park offers an unparalleled experience for those who love the outdoors. The park is comprised of five of the eight Channel Islands, including all those in the northern group (Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel) and one in the southern group (Santa Barbara). Although included within the Park, the western 76 percent of Santa Cruz is owned by the Nature Conservancy and all of San Miguel is owned by the U.S. Navy. The ark includes the smallest of California’s Channel Islands (Anacapa and Santa Barbara), the largest (Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa) and San Miguel which is moderately-sized. Santa Cruz Island is the most rugged topographically of the five islands, with elevations reaching about 2,500 feet and is the only one with an interior watershed between two mountain ranges. The Park is blessed with unusually abundant prehistoric and historic resources spanning the period from about 13,000 years ago with the Native American Chumash to the historic ranching period of the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
		  
		  <h5>The Environment</h5>
		  	
		  	<p>The waters surrounding the Channel Islands strongly influences the environment of each, collectively and individually of them is strongly influenced by the cool-water California Current flowing southward along the California coast and along the outer margin of the Southern California Bight and by the warm-water California Countercurrent (Davidson Current) flowing northward along the coast. The meeting and mixing of these currents forms an east-west gradient in water temperatures through the Santa Barbara Channel and both northwest southeast gradients (depending on the season) through the bight as a whole. Sea surface temperatures at the eastern tip of Anacapa Island, the easternmost of the northern Channel Islands, average roughly 4-5°F warmer than waters adjacent to the western end of San Miguel Island. This variation strongly influences the distribution and abundance of marine faunal species. Located significantly south and east of the northern Channel Islands, waters surrounding Santa Barbara Island generally are warmer than those surrounding the northern Channel Islands.</p>
		  
		  <h5>The Climate</h5>
		  
		  	<p>The islands have a Mediterranean climate and vegetation heavily influenced by their maritime environment although there are differences in each of the islands. Air temperatures are coolest from December through March, with coolest temperatures typically ranging between approximately 52 and 59°F. During the summer months the warmest temperatures typically range between 61 to 70°F, although the Central Valley of Santa Cruz Island experiences summer temperatures as high as 90°F. Generally, air temperatures are cooler on the westernmost and warmest on the easternmost of the islands, the difference generally being more than 4°F from western San Miguel Island to East Anacapa Island. Santa Barbara Island air temperatures typically are warmer than on the northern group of islands. Prevailing winds are from the northwest to west during all seasons. They are strongest on San Miguel Island and western Santa Rosa Island, often reaching velocities 30-50 mph. Winds are also relatively strong in exposed portions of western Santa Cruz Island, but the complex relief of the island generally results in many locations being protected from strong winds. Strong, dry, and often relatively warm Santa Ana winds coming from the east and northeast occasionally occur, particularly during autumn. Precipitation on the islands falls mainly during the months from November to April. The amount varies with topography (elevation in particular) and latitude, with parts of Santa Cruz Island receiving as much as 20 inches per year whereas Santa Barbara Island may receive as little as 8 inches.</p>
