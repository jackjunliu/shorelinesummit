          <p>A waterproof galley allows divers to come in out of the weather with their wetsuits on and enjoy something to eat, work on their camera equipment or just relax. Centrally located heads are waterproof and are convenient to use during the dive day. Hot water showers are located on deck for a quick rinse. There is also a below deck shower room.</p>
		
			<p>The bunkroom has comfortable single and double bunks that offer curtains and reading lights as well as pillows and blankets along with a dressing room. A large sundeck is available for relaxing between dives or to enjoy during sunrises and sunsets with your favorite beverage. Kayaks can be stored on a rack out of the way and do not clutter the decks.</p>

		  	<h5>Lifesaving Equipment</h5>
		  
		  <p>All lifesaving equipment including lifejackets and rafts are located on the sundeck behind the wheelhouse. Should the need arise, this is where a crewman will be passing out the safety equipment. Please review the placard located in each bunk for proper donning of lifejackets.</p>
                    
          <h5>Galley</h5>
		  
		  <p>While hard equipment (tanks and weight belts) needs to be removed before entering the cabin from the deck, everyone is welcome into the galley with their wetsuits on and dripping wet.</p>
          
          <p>When using an onboard cup, please use a provided dry-erase pen to put a name on the cup so it can be reused by the diver for the duration of the trip.</p>
          
          <p>If there are special dietary needs, please inform the galley staff early of the first morning of any requests.</p>
          
          <h5>Meal Service Times</h5>
		  
		  <p><b>Breakfast</b> is served from 7:00 – 9:00 am. If arriving late, there is always a variety of cereals, pastries and fruit left out until 10:30 am.<br>
          <b>Lunch</b> is served from 12:00 – 1:00 pm. If diving at that time, please understand that the galley staffs will have moved on to other jobs so ask them early to put a plate aside for eating later.<br>
          <b>Dinner</b> is usually served at 6:00 pm.</p>
		  
          <h5>Bunk Room</h5>
		  
		  <p>Smoking is not allowed below decks nor is wet gear which should be left upstairs.</p>
          
          <h5>Shower Room</h5>
		  
		  <p>The shower room is located down the forward staircase on the Vision and Conception dive boats and in the stern compartment on the Truth dive boat. Please help conserve our on board fresh water supply by taking only one shower a day and not rinsing gear in the shower.</p>
          
          <h5>Drying Room</h5>
		  
		  <p>This room is located at the back of the boat accessible from the Main Deck. This is where you can hang your wetsuit to dry anytime you like. Warm air delivered from the engine room heats this area. There is also a clothes dryer for your towels and bathing suits (no wetsuits). Have courtesy to those with dried clothes by taking them out and placing them on top of the dryer.</p>
          
          <h5>Kayak Rack</h5>
		  
		  <p>A kayak rack is provided for out-of-the-way storage of kayaks. Please ask a crew member for help when taking kayaks on or off the rack. Be sure to inform the crew about planned kayaking destinations and the length of time for the expected sojourn. Flotation devices and wetsuits are recommended for protection from exposure. The boat is equipped with extra life jackets.</p>
          
          <h5>Parking</h5>
		  
		  <p>Please use the Santa Barbara Harbor parking lot and park only in white single stalls. The yellow double-length stalls are reserved for vehicles with boat trailers and those parking there will be ticketed or towed. Bring the parking stub into the dive boat office at the Sea Landing and the staff will validate it for a reduced rate of $3/day.</p>
