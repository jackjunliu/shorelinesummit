They can also be used for business associates.</p>

		  	<p>There a dozens of anchorages at the five islands that make up Channel Islands National Park, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and the coast along a large portion of Santa Cruz Island managed by the Nature Conservancy.</p>

		    <h5>Weather</h5>
		  
		  <p>Conditions in the Santa Barbara Channel and around the islands are variable and the ocean is unforgiving. Weather conditions vary considerably in the channel. Extreme weather conditions may be encountered at any time and the sea conditions may become dangerous without warning. The calmest winds and sea conditions often occur August through October. The other months are subject to a much greater chance for adverse wind and seas with sudden unexpected changes. High winds may occur regardless of the forecast. Forty-knot winds are not unusual for Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands. Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands have more moderate winds. Winds are often calm in the early morning and increase during the afternoon. Generally the wind comes from the northwest but kayakers must be also be prepared for strong east or Santa Ana winds at any time, especially from September through April.</p>
          
          <p>Dense fog is common during the summer months, but may occur at any time, making chart and compass navigation mandatory. Ocean currents of considerable strength may be encountered both near and offshore from the islands. Ocean water temperatures range from the lower 50s (F) in the winter to the upper 60s (F) in the fall.</p>
          
          <p>It's advisable to check weather conditions before departing in order to get a sense of what to expect while on the islands.</p>
