          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) created the National Marine Sanctuary which spans 1,470 square miles surrounding five of the Channel Islands, the land which is managed by Channel Islands National Park Service and the Nature Conservancy including: Anacapa, San Miguel, Santa Barbara , Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands. Due to the often windy conditions on Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands, these activities are best done on Santa Barbara, Anacapa and eastern Santa Cruz Islands. The kelp forests, sea caves, and coves of the park await the adventurous swimmer and snorkeler.</p>

        <h5>The Underwater Experience</h5>
        
		  		<div class="col-md-10">
		  	<ul>  
		To say that the Channel Islands provide one of the best snorkeling environments in the world is not an understatement. With kelp forests up to 120 feet in height from the sea floor to the surface, divers can experience more than 800 types of marine life. There is a wide variety of underwater adventures just waiting to be explored (again and again) including:	
    	<li><b>Fish</b> - halibut, lingcod, sea bass, rock fish, bat rays …</li>
    	<li><b>Mammals</b> - seals, sea lions and dolphin as well as several species of whales</li>
    	<li><b>Shellfish</b> - scallop, crab, spiny lobsters …</li>
    	<li><b>Sea Floor Residents</b> - starfish, urchin, sea cucumbers, eels, anemones, octopus</li>
    	<li><b>Plant Life</b> - kelp forests and other colorful plant life</li>  
			</ul>
		  </div>
		  <p>
          Since the marine environment can be unforgiving, use extra caution when engaging in these activities. Ocean conditions are highly variable and sometimes dangerous. Many beaches on the islands have steep, dangerous shore breaks. The wind and swell generally come from the northwest and become stronger as the day continues. From October through January, visitors must also be prepared for strong east or Santa Ana winds. The ocean currents outside of coves and protected beach areas can be strong and extremely dangerous. These conditions should be carefully considered when planning your trip and entering the water.p

		  <h5>Weather</h5>
		  
		  <p>Kayakers should be prepared for a variety of weather conditions, especially on the outer islands. Thirty-knot winds are not uncommon on Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands. Sturdy, low-profile tents, stakes and line for securing tents to ground, table or wind shelters are recommended.</p>
		  
		  <p>Fog can occur on the islands during any season producing cool, damp conditions.</p>
		  
		<p>It’s advisable to check weather conditions before departing in order to get a sense of what to expect while on the islands.</p>

          <h5>Typical Daytripper Adventure</h5>
		<p>The trip includes ferry boat tickets & kayaks (paddle jackets, helmets and wetsuits are recommended but not for rent). If inclined to snorkel on your visit, bring your own gear including a warm wetsuit, hood, snorkel, mask and fins at no additional charge.</p>

		<p>The adventure starts around 8:00am and returns around 5:00-6:00pm although actual start and finish times may vary. The most common destinations are Scorpion Anchorage and Painted Cave, both on Santa Cruz Island. Beginners through advanced levels are welcome. Children under 12 must ride in double kayak with a parent.</p>

			<h5>Safety:</h5>
		</div>
        
		<div class="col-md-10">
		  	<ul>
		Please follow these saftey regulations:		
    	<li>Use the “buddy system.” There are no lifeguards on duty. Kayaking is at your own risk. Stay together and paddle within the skills of the least experienced paddler in the group.</li>
    	<li>Obtain current weather and sea conditions. The conditions around the islands are considered “open ocean.” Extreme weather conditions may be encountered at any time and sea conditions may become dangerous without warning. There is no place where visitors will be kayaking in a protected cove. Always observe and evaluate sea conditions before entering the water. Be alert to wind, wave, and currents at all times.</li>
    	<li>Do not travel downwind (with the wind) as you will have to return into a headwind. Wind and waves typically come out of the northwest or west. Winds tend to increase in the afternoon. Morning hours can be a better time for kayaking and other watersports. Challenging Santa Ana or east winds may occur at any time, but are most common from September through April.</li>
    	<li>Do not exceed your skill level. If you are new to sea kayaking or other watersports, stay close to your launch area and paddle with an experienced kayaker. Ask National Park Service personnel or kayak guides if you have questions concerning weather, safety, etc. Be capable of re-entering your kayak from the water.</li>
    	<li>Let someone know where you are going and when you expect to return. Kayakers should always file a “float plan” with family and/or friends and inform them of your departure and return. The float plan should include: 1) the number of boats and boaters on the trip as well as the color, size and type of craft used; 2) names and addresses for the boaters as well as emergency phone numbers; 3) any survival and special emergency equipment should be listed (EPIRB, VHF, food rations, flares, etc.); and 4) the place, date and time of departure and return should be logged as well as destination(s). This information can be invaluable for a search operation if something goes wrong. Remember to be flexible with your plans. Weather should always determine your course of action.</li>
    	<li>Carefully select and equip your paddle craft. Craft should be of a sea kayak design and kayakers must have the following: 1) lifejackets-all paddlers must have lifejackets; 2) helmets should always be worn when paddling below cliffs and in sea caves; 3) VHF radio, tow line, compass, throw bag, first aid kit, signaling device (air horn, whistle or signal mirror) and make sure you know how to use them; and 4) wetsuits are highly recommended since water temperatures remain cold throughout the year.</li>

        <h5>Landing Permits and Procedures</h5>
		<p>There are no landing permits required for the islands administered by the National Park Service. Please note that rocks or islets on or near any of the islands are closed year-round to any landing and pets are not allowed in the park. There are closed and restricted areas on each island. Kayakers may land according to the following procedures:</p>
        <div class="col-md-10">
		  	<ul>
        <li><b>Anacapa Island</b> - A permit is not required to land or hike on East Anacapa Island or at Frenchy’s Cove. West Anacapa (except Frenchy’s Cove) is a protected research natural area and is closed to visitors. Visitors are allowed on Middle Anacapa by permit only and when accompanied by a park ranger.</li>
    	<li><b>San Miguel Island</b> - Kayakers may land only on the beach at Cuyler Harbor. Visitors may walk the beach at Cuyler Harbor and hike up Nidever Canyon to the ranger station. To hike beyond the ranger station, visitors must be escorted by a ranger and have a permit. </li>
    	<li><b>Santa Barbara Island</b> - A permit is not required to land or hike on Santa Barbara Island. Access to the island is permitted only at the landing cove. The landing dock is available for unloading purposes only. No craft, including kayaks and inflatables, should be left moored to the dock.</li>
    	<li><b>Santa Cruz Island</b> - Boaters may land and hike on the eastern 24% of Santa Cruz Island without a permit. This area is owned by the National Park Service and is east of the property line between Prisoners Harbor and Valley Anchorage. Due to surf and swell conditions, boaters should use extreme caution when making surf-landings at any beach, especially Smugglers Cove and those beaches facing south and southeast between San Pedro Point and Sandstone Point. A landing permit, however, is required to land on Nature Conservancy property which manages the western 76% of Santa Cruz Island. A fee is charged and no overnight island use is permitted. Allow 10-12 days for processing.</li>
    	<li><b>Santa Rosa Island</b> - Boaters may land along coastline and on beaches without a permit for day-use only. From March 1 to September 15, the back beaches and sand dunes between and including Skunk Point to just north of East Point are closed to hiking to protect the nesting area for the snowy plover, a federally listed, threatened shorebird. Please remain on the wet sand (below mean high tide) or the road throughout this area. The beaches around Sandy Point are closed year-round. A pier is available at Becher’s Bay.</li>
