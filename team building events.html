		  	<h5>More About Team Building</h5>
			<p>Team building is a philosophy of job design in which employees are viewed as members of interdependent teams instead of as individual workers. Team building can range from simple bonding exercises to complex simulations and multi-day team building retreats. These retreats can be designed to develop a team including group assessment and group-dynamic games, and fulfill a variety of other purposes. Team building is not to be confused with "team recreation" which consists of activities for teams that are strictly recreational. It can also be seen in day-to-day operations of an organization and team dynamic can be improved through successful leadership.</p>

			<p>Team building is said to have benefits of self-development, positive communication, leadership skills and the ability to work closely together as a team to solve problems. Team building focuses on four methods that affect the unit: 1) role clarification; 2) interpersonal relationship management; 3) goal setting; and 4) problem solving.</p>

			<p>Work environments tend to focus on individuals and personal goals, with reward and recognition singling out the achievements of individual employees whereas team building focuses on the group and, additionally, refer to the process of selecting or creating a new team.</p>

		  	<h5>Team Dynamic</h5>
			<p>When assembling a team it is very important to consider the overall dynamic of the team. Five dynamics are fundamental to team success:</p>
		  	<div class="col-md-10">
		  	<ol>
				<li><b>Team Members: </b>Successful teams are made up of a collection of effective individuals. These are people who are experienced, have problem solving ability, are open to addressing the problem, and are action oriented.</li>
				<li><b>Team Relationships: </b>For a team to be successful the members of the team must be able to give and receive feedback.</li>
				<li><b>Team Problem Solving: </b>An effective team depends on how focused and clear the goal of the team is. A relaxed, comfortable and accepting environment and finally, open and honest communication are required.</li>
				<li><b>Team Leadership: </b>Effective team leadership depends on leadership competencies. A competent leader is: focused on the goal, ensures a collaborative climate, builds confidence of team members, sets priorities, demonstrates sufficient “know-how” and manages performance through feedback.</li>
				<li><b>Organizational Environment: </b>The climate and culture of the organization must be conductive to team behavior. Competitiveness should be discouraged and collaboration should be encouraged - this will minimize conflict and discord among team members.</li>
		  	</ol>

		  	<h5>Types of Exercises</h5>
			<p>Shoreline Summit Adventures provides opportunities to focus on the above mentioned four primary types of team building activities including communication, problem solving, adaptability/problem solving and trust building. Team building can range from simple social activities from encouraging team members to spend time together to team development activities designed to help individuals discover how they approach a problem, how the team works together and discover better methods of communication. Team interaction involves “soft” interpersonal skills including communication, negotiation, leadership and motivation in contrast to technical skills directly involved with the job at hand. Depending on the type of team building, the tasks can encourage or specifically teach interpersonal team skills to increase team performance. The purpose of team building exercises is to assist teams in becoming cohesive units of individuals that can effectively work together to complete tasks. Examples of each of the four types of team building activities are listed, below:</p>

		  	<h5>1. Communication Exercises</h5>
			<p>This type of team building exercise is exactly what it sounds like. Communications exercises are problem solving activities that are geared towards improving communication skills. The issues teams encounter in these exercises are solved by communicating effectively with each other. The goal is to create an activity which highlights the importance of good communication in team performance and/or potential problems with communication.</p>

			<h5>2. Problem-Solving/Decision-Making Exercises</h5>
			<p>Problem-solving/decision-making exercises focus specifically on groups working together to solve difficult problems or make complex decisions. These exercises are some of the most common as they appear to have the most direct link to what employers want their teams to be able to do. The goal is to give team a problem in which the solution is not easily apparent or requires the team to come up with a creative solution.</p>

			<h5>3. Planning/Adaptability Exercises</h5>
			<p>These exercises focus on aspects of planning and being adaptable to change. These are important things for teams to be able to do when they are assigned complex tasks or decisions. The goal is to show the importance of planning before implementing a solution.</p>

			<h5>4. Trust Exercises</h5>
			<p>A trust exercise involves engaging team members in a way that will induce trust between them. They are sometimes difficult exercises to implement as there are varying degrees of trust between individuals and varying degrees of individual comfort trusting others in general. The goal is to create trust between team members. These exercises can be effective for many teams but none are a one-size-fits-all solution.</p>

			<h5>Team Building Assessment and Feedback</h5>
			<p>In the organizational development context, a team may embark on a process of self-assessment to gauge its effectiveness and improve its performance. To assess itself, a team seeks feedback from group members to find out both its current strengths and weakness. Participating in adventures offered through Shoreline Summit Adventures provides one way to improve team performance by using feedback from the team assessment can be used to identify gaps between the desired goal and current position with team members engaging in strategy sessions designed to close the gap between the two.</p>

			<h5>Day-Tripper Channel Islands Motor Charter Experience</h5>
			<p>Crossing the Santa Barbara Channel to Santa Cruz Island takes more than an hour with a stop along the way for a peak (inside!) the second longest sea cave in the world. Continue down the coast of Santa Cruz Island and drop anchor in a remote bay for lunch and a swim before your return back to the mainland just in time for dinner. The contemporary interiors are calming and comfortable. You will think you were transported to the South Coast of France or the Amalfi Coast of Italy for a picnic tour on a European-style motor yacht.</p>

			<h5>Multi-Day Channel Islands Motor Charter Experience</h5>
			<p>Explore one island by land and sea or visit several of the Channel Islands.</p>

			<h5>Day-Tripper Sailing Charter Experience</h5>
			<p>Due to the slower speeds when sailing, day trips are generally along the coast of Santa Barbara with opportunities to anchor for lunch and participate in water activities like swimming, kayaking and paddleboarding.</p>

			<h5>Multi-Day Channel Islands Sailing Charter Experience</h5>
			<p>Crossing the Santa Barbara Channel to Santa Cruz Island takes 4-7 hours depending on wind, sea conditions and island(s) to be visited. Explore one island by land and sea or visit several of the Channel Islands.</p>
