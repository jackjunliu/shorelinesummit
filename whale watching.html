          	<p>The waters surrounding Channel Islands National Park are home to many diverse and beautiful whales. About one third of the whale species found worldwide can be seen in the Santa Barbara Channel. The many species sighted in the channel include gray, blue, humpback, minke, sperm and pilot whales as well as orcas.</p>
			
			<p>This diversity of cetacean species offers a great opportunity to whale watch year-round. The most common sightings are of gray whales from mid- to late-December through mid-March, blue and humpback whales during the summer, and common dolphin throughout the entire year.</p>

		<p>Closer viewing of whales is possible from the whale watching boats we charter for our adventures. Whales have been known to approach boats quite closely. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, boaters must stay at least 100 yards from whales unless the whale chooses to approach the boat. Many whales are on the endangered species list and should be treated with special care. All whales are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act; it is illegal to disturb or harm any marine mammal. Please remember that whales are wild animals and can be unpredictable.</p>

			<h5>Whale Habits</h5>
		</div>
		  
		<p>Whether you are watching from shore or in a boat, here are a few distinctive habits to look for:</p>
		  
		<ul>
			<li><b>Spouts</b> – Your first indication of a whale will probably be its spout or “blow.” It will be visible for many miles on a calm day, and an explosive “whoosh” of exhalation may be heard up to 1/2 mile away. The spout is mainly condensation created as the whale’s warm, humid breath expands and cools in the sea air.</li>
			<li><b>Breaching</b> – No one knows why whales perform this most spectacular of their behaviors. It may be part of the courtship display, a signal, an effort to dislodge parasites, an expression of stress or just for fun. When breaching, three-quarters or more of the whale’s body bursts forth from the water, pivots onto its side or back, and falls back with an enormous splash.</li>
			<li><b>Diving</b> – Whales typically thrust their tail flukes out of the water prior to diving. Whales tend to make a series of shallow dives followed by a deep dive.</li>
			<li><b>Footprints</b> – Ripples caused by the vertical thrusts of the tail as the whale dives are called “footprints.”</li>
			<li><b>Spyhopping</b> – Whales and dolphins are believed to have reasonable vision in air as well as water. On occasion, a whale will extend its head vertically from the sea. Supported by thrusting flukes, the whale’s head can rise 8-10 feet above the surface, sometimes turning slowly for thirty seconds or more before slipping back underwater.</li>
