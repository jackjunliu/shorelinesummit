			<p>Shoreline Summit, as a company and logo, was created in 1980 by founder Charles M. Bloom. An early adopter of the internet as a retailer (starting a month after Amazon and a month before E-Bay), Mr. Bloom created Shoreline Acoustic Music. At the time, it was the best known acoustic guitar retailer in the world with 3,500 customers in 120 countries. Mr. Bloom sold that business in 2000.</p>
			
			<p>Shoreline Summit Adventures donates 10% percentage of profits to Channel Island stewards of the land and surrounding ocean environments including the Channel Islands National Park Service, the Nature Conservancy and the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary which is a part of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>

			<p>We are a B Corporation, a designation to sustainable businesses in much the same way LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certifications are to green building or a Fair Trade certification is to coffee. B Corporations are certified by the nonprofit B Lab to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. Today, there is a growing community of over 1,000 Certified B Corps (including Ben & Jerry’s and Patagonia) from more than 30 countries and 60 industries working together toward one unifying goal: to redefine success in business. Shoreline Summit Adventures is proud to be a member of this business community.</p>

			<p>Shoreline Summit Adventures offers adventure travel to California’s Channel Islands off the coast of Santa Barbara where the company is based. These islands compare favorably with alternative adventure travel options including the thrill of heli-skiing in Alaska, bungee jumping in New Zealand, swimming with dolphin in the Caribbean, participating in an African safari, rafting down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, diving along the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, climbing Everest, motorcycling through the Alps and other, iconic, bucket list places. The Channel Islands are pristine and beautiful with endless adventure travel options. More importantly, they are not famous and, therefore, offer a new world of exploration for adventure travel enthusiasts. Five of the eight islands in the chain are part of the National Park Service with the majority of the land and marine environment controlled by the National Parks and a minority managed by the Nature Conservancy. The Channel Islands is one of the least visited National Parks, accessible by boat in 1-5 hours (depending upon the island one wants to visit) and 12-35 miles from the Santa Barbara or Ventura harbors.</p>

			<p>Adventure travel services offered by Shoreline Summit Adventures on and around the Channel Islands include sailing, diving, kayaking, surfing, fishing, hiking and camping at the Channel Islands. Participants in these activities can do self-guided tours or opt (and pay) for professionally-guided ones. Private events (e.g. sunset cruises, private events ...) are offered in and around the Santa Barbara area. Catered meals, music and entertainment are also available options. Our adventure travel clientele also has the opportunity to sign up for courses to get sailing certifications from the American Sailing Association (ASA) from which Mr. Bloom is a certified sailing instructor as well as a U.S. Coast Guard Licensed Captain. Certifications in scuba diving from either the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI) or the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) are also offered. And finally, artistically-oriented clientele have the opportunity to photograph or paint on their own or as part of a group workshop facilitated by a professional photography and painting instructors.</p>

			<p>The dedicated amateur as well as professional photographer or painter are able to post their work on our website and have it available for purchase in a variety of formats (e.g. someone may not want to purchase a photograph for several hundred dollars or a painting for thousands of dollars but they may want the image on a more affordable coffee cup or t-shirt). Moreover, dedicated amateurs and real amateurs can participate in calendar contests and other competitions. These images can also be posted on Shoreline Summit Adventures’ social networking sites.</p>

			<p>In sum, Shoreline Summit Adventures is the only company offering the array of services and adventure opportunities for everything related to the enchanted experience of the Channel Islands.</p>
