          <p>Whether you're looking for an afternoon sail, sunset cruise, whale watching, want to learn to sail or, if you're experienced, charter your own sailboat and sail to the Channel Islands off the coast, there's no better way to experience the Pacific Ocean on the west coast of the United States than sailing from Santa Barbara. Shoreline Summit Adventures offers all options from day sailboats rentals to cruising yacht charters up to 50 feet in length.</p>

		  	<p>There are many sailing classes available varying from learning the basics in a couple of hours to receiving American Sailing Association (ASA) certifications from a 2-time ASA Sailing School of the Year winning school.</p>
		  
		  <h5>Weather</h5>
		  
		  <p>Conditions in the Santa Barbara Channel and around the islands are variable and the ocean is unforgiving. Weather conditions vary considerably in the channel. Extreme weather conditions may be encountered at any time and the sea conditions may become dangerous without warning. The calmest winds and sea conditions often occur August through October. The other months are subject to a much greater chance for adverse wind and seas with sudden unexpected changes. High winds may occur regardless of the forecast. Forty-knot winds are not unusual for Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands. Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands have more moderate winds. Winds are often calm in the early morning and increase during the afternoon. Generally the wind comes from the northwest but kayakers must be also be prepared for strong east or Santa Ana winds at any time, especially from September through April.</p>
          
          <p>Dense fog is common during the summer months, but may occur at any time, making chart and compass navigation mandatory. Ocean currents of considerable strength may be encountered both near and offshore from the islands. Ocean water temperatures range from the lower 50s (F) in the winter to the upper 60s (F) in the fall.</p>
          
          <p>It's advisable to check weather conditions before departing in order to get a sense of what to expect while on the islands.</p>
