          <p>The three boats in the fleet were designed and built by divers as dive boats and not converted from some prior use. Many of the features are unique including circulating mask rinsers at each exit to a submerged ramp and boarding step for easy boarding after a dive. Large benches at the bow and stern make suiting up easier while a special warm-air room dries wet suits quickly between dives. Dual air compressors allow rapid tank refilling so there is never a wait for the next dive.</p>
			
            <p>Dive boat captain Roy Hauser founded Truth Aquatics in 1974. Roy's partner beginning in 1979, Glen Fritzler, is the current owner and operator of all the dive boats in the fleet.</p>

		  <p>For those who like to fish, there are live game wells as well as deep freezers to store freshly caught fish. The bunkroom has comfortable single and double bunks that offer curtains and reading lights as well as pillows and blankets along with a dressing room. A large sundeck is available for relaxing between dives or to enjoy during sunrises and sunsets with your favorite beverage.</p>
          
          <p>Hot water showers are located on deck for a quick rinse. There is also a below deck shower room. A waterproof galley allows divers to come in out of the weather with their wetsuits on and enjoy something to eat, work on their camera equipment or just relax. Centrally located heads are waterproof and are convenient to use during the dive day. Kayaks can be stored on a rack out of the way and do not clutter the decks.</p>

          		<h5>Truth</h5>
		  		<p>In 1973 Roy designed and built the Truth with boat builder Mac McCaully in Venice California. It was launched as California's first state-of-the-art liveaboard dive boat just 10 months later. At the time, the Truth was considered the nicest and best laid out dive boat on the entire California coast having innovations including a waterproof galley, circulating mask rinsers at each exit and an easy to board swim step.</p>

          		<h5>Conception</h5>
		  		<p>In 1981, the Conception was launched and brought a new meaning to the word "liveaboard." A larger vessel with new innovations such as circulating game wells, below deck shower room, air-conditioned bunkroom, large sundeck and a built in bar-b-que were just a few ideas that set this liveaboard boat in its own class.</p>
