		  	<p>Within the workshops, you will spend your time garnering knowledge and techniques that have taken years to perfect. The instructors will interact with you explaining their processes and techniques with one-on-one time to review and inspire your art.</p>

		<p>The workshops are 3 days and 2 nights aboard a cruising sailboat. The sail across the Santa Barbara Channel is 4-7 hours depending on wind and water conditions as well as the island(s) to be visited. On the cruise, you will have the opportunity to get to know the workshop leader, other participants, observe migrating whales as well as year-round residents like dolphin, sea lions and birds and, most importantly, get into the rhythm of the experience.</p>

		<p>Nights are spent aboard the sailboat (bring a sleeping bag) in cabins that accommodate two. Meals are either onboard or taken as box/bag lunches to shore to paint or photograph with the workshop leader. Mornings and evenings are available for relaxing or workshop classes.</p>

		<p>Typical days are spent on the island honing and improving your skills under the guidance of the workshop leaders. This is an amazing way to enhance your art in a beautiful place to create and have an enchanted experience you’ll never forget.</p>

          <p>
          <h5>Tim Hauf</h5>
		  <p>After graduating from North Dakota State University with a degree in business, Tim Hauf moved to California and found work as a financial analyst. With the outdoors beckoning, Tim left that career path and moved to Ventura County in the late 1970s. He found himself working as a ranch foreman which gave him enough time to take up photography. Tim has been honing his skills ever since.</p>

		<p>Tim has been a professional photographer since the early 1990s. His photographs have been featured in numerous publications throughout the world, including Islands, Sunset, Asia Pacific Travel, Mini-World (Japan), Explore (Canada), Terre Sauvage (France), Dove (Italy), South Africa Times, USA Today, National Geographic, Smithsonian, and many others. His list of published books include unique destinations such as the Himalaya of Nepal; South America’s remote Patagonia; the rugged wilderness of northern Manitoba, Canada; South Africa’s remarkable World Heritage Sites; Ventura County; and Channel Islands National Park. In addition to having his work displayed in numerous solo and group exhibitions, Tim’s work is also part of the permanent art collection at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, California.</p>

		<p>A respected photographer he is frequently asked to judge photography competitions and/or give talks and workshops on photography. He is also available for private workshops (group or individual) to destinations around the world.</p>
