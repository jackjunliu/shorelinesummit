          <p>Camping is available year round on all five islands in Channel Islands National Park in National Park Service-managed campgrounds. There is currently one established campground on each island: above the Landing Cove on Santa Barbara on the east islet of Anacapa, at Scorpion Ranch on Santa Cruz, at Water Canyon on Santa Rosa and above Cuyler Harbor on San Miguel. No camping is allowed on the Nature Conservancy’s western 76 percent of Santa Cruz Island. Limited backcountry camping is available on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands.</p>

		  	<p>Advanced camping reservations are required for all of the campgrounds. There are no entrance fees to visit the park. However, a reservation fee is charged for camping on the islands. The $15.00 per night-per site fee includes both the National Park Service fee that supports the operation and maintenance of the campgrounds and the reservation fee charged by the contractor that manages the National Reservation Service.</p>
		  
		  	<p>Reservations can be made no more than five months in advance. Information required for the reservations includes: camping dates, transportation information, and number of campers. Reservations can be made by calling 877.444.6777. A confirmation notice will be mailed to campers. This notice needs to be presented to the island ranger upon arrival.</p>

		  <h5>Campground Facilities</h5>
		  <p>All campgrounds are located away from the boat landing areas. Visitors must carry all their gear to the campgrounds. No on-island transportation is provided. Please see the table below for more information on campground distances from landings.</p>
		  
		  <p>Camping conditions are primitive, and users must camp within designated areas. All campgrounds are equipped with picnic tables and pit toilets. Water is not available at campgrounds and must be brought with you except at the Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Island campgrounds. No trash containers are provided; campers must pack out their own trash.</p>
		  
		  <p>Outer island campgrounds (San Miguel and Santa Rosa) have wind breaks for each campsite. Campsites are generally located close to one another.</p>
		  
		  <p>No fires are permitted. Use only enclosed, gas camp stoves.</p>
		  
		  <p>Since the mice do carry hantavirus, some basic precautions should be taken: 1) do not feed any wild animals; 2) keep food and drink in rodent-proof containers; 3) and prevent entry of mice into your tent by keeping it zipped up at all times.</p>
		  
		  <p>Due to scavenging animals (including birds), campers are required to store all food and trash in animal and bird-proof containers. National Park Service food storage boxes are provided at campsites, but coolers, plastic Rubbermaid-type boxes or other types of containers with sealing lids may be used as well.</p>
		  
		  <p>In addition, at the Scorpion Ranch campground on Santa Cruz Island, foxes and ravens are capable of opening zippers. To further secure your food and trash, safety pins, twist ties, paper clips and small carabiners are suggested to help keep zippers closed.</p>
		  
		  <h5>Weather</h5>
		  
		  <p>Campers should be prepared for a variety of weather conditions, especially on the outer islands. Thirty-knot winds are not uncommon on Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands. Sturdy, low-profile tents, stakes and line for securing tents to ground, table or wind shelters are recommended.</p>
		  
		  <p>Fog can occur on the islands during any season producing cool, damp conditions.</p>
		  
		  <p>All of the campgrounds, except eastern Santa Cruz, are located away from trees and shade. Overexposure to the wind and sun can be a serious problem.</p>

		<p>Visitors are advised to bring supplies for an extra day in case boats are unable to pick up campers due to sea conditions.</p>

		<p>It’s advisable to check weather conditions before departing in order to get a sense of what to expect while on the islands.</p>

		  <h5>Suggested Camping Gear</h5>
		<p>Campers must be prepared for the primitive campground facilities and weather conditions. Supplies and gear are not available on the islands. Gear must be transported up ladders at most landing areas and carried some distance to the campgrounds.
		  
		<p>Packing your gear in backpacks, duffle bags and containers with handles makes transportation easier. Items should weigh no more than 45 pounds each.</p>

		<p>On some islands, visitors may get wet during loading and off-loading so waterproof your gear. An extra pair of shoes packed in waterproof material is recommended.</p>

		<p>Campers should plan to layer clothing as weather conditions tend to change from cool and damp in the mornings to bright, warm, and windy during the afternoons. Clothing that protects against wind is advisable year-round. Hiking boots are recommended for most island trails.</p>
