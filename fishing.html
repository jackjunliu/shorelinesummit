          <p>Off the coast of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, the Channel Islands offer a tremendous variety of sportfishing. Fishing in the warmer months can be sensational for rock cod, ling cod, calico bass, bonito, barracuda, yellowtail, white sea bass and occasional migrating albacore. Santa Cruz and its smaller companions Anacapa, Santa Rosa and San Miguel offer excellent rock codding.</p>

		  	<p>Day runs include 1/2 day trips, 3/4 day and full day trips. There are many overnight and multiday trip boats with full galleys and bunks. The comfort and safety of passengers is the top priority. All boats are well-equipped and certified by the USCG yearly. All have EPIRBS and life rafts.</p>
		  
		<h5>Fishing by Season:</h5>
		  
		<div class="col-md-10">
		  	<ul>
				<li><b>Spring: </b>This is the best season for time fishing for rockfish. There are opportunities to fish for white sea bass when conditions permit. King salmon can occasionally be caught.</li>
				<li><b>Summer: </b>Fishing in the summer is a great time for white sea bass and rockfish. In warmer temperatures, yellowtail fishing is a possibility. </li>
				<li><b>Fall: </b>The best weather of the year is often in the fall. Warm days and cool nights are the normal weather patterns during this season.</li>
				<li><b>Winter: </b>While there can be “weather” in the winter, it can be pleasant much of this season. This is the season to fish for white sea bass as well as rockfish and whitefish. From time to time, salmon are also running.</li>
		  	</ul>
		  </div>
		  	<p>	  
		  <h5>Weather</h5>
		  
		  <p>Conditions in the Santa Barbara Channel and around the islands are variable and the ocean is unforgiving. Weather conditions vary considerably in the channel. Extreme weather conditions may be encountered at any time and the sea conditions may become dangerous without warning. The calmest winds and sea conditions often occur August through October. The other months are subject to a much greater chance for adverse wind and seas with sudden unexpected changes. High winds may occur regardless of the forecast. Forty-knot winds are not unusual for Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands. Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands have more moderate winds. Winds are often calm in the early morning and increase during the afternoon. Generally the wind comes from the northwest but kayakers must be also be prepared for strong east or Santa Ana winds at any time, especially from September through April.</p>
          
          <p>Dense fog is common during the summer months, but may occur at any time, making chart and compass navigation mandatory. Ocean currents of considerable strength may be encountered both near and offshore from the islands. Ocean water temperatures range from the lower 50s (F) in the winter to the upper 60s (F) in the fall.</p>
          
          <p>It's advisable to check weather conditions before departing in order to get a sense of what to expect while on the islands.</p>
