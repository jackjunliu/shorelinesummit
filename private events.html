		<p>When it comes to rewarding top performing employees there is no better way to recognize their hard work and recent achievements than with a luxury yacht charter. High-achieving employees, along with their spouses and families will remember a day or week-long charter experience for a lifetime, with water toys and luxury amenities on board to ensure there is something for everyone. This unique and positive business incentive will motivate employees in a way like no other, leaving them feeling valued, rewarded and thoroughly rejuvenated.</p>

		<p>Subject to maritime regulations, many luxury yachts can accommodate a maximum of 8 to 12 charter guests. For larger parties it is an option to reserve more than one charter yacht.</p>

		<h5>Day-Tripper Channel Islands Motor Charter Experience</h5>
		<p>Crossing the Santa Barbara Channel to Santa Cruz Island takes more than an hour with a stop along the way for a peak (inside!) the second longest sea cave in the world. Continue down the coast of Santa Cruz Island and drop anchor in a remote bay for lunch and a swim before your return back to the mainland just in time for dinner. The contemporary interiors are calming and comfortable. You will think you were transported to the South Coast of France or the Amalfi Coast of Italy for a picnic tour on a European-style motor yacht.</p>

		<h5>Multi-Day Channel Islands Motor Charter Experience</h5>
		<p>Explore one island by land and sea or visit several of the Channel Islands.</p>

		<h5>Day-Tripper Sailing Charter Experience</h5>
		<p>Due to the slower speeds when sailing, day trips are generally along the coast of Santa Barbara with opportunities to anchor for lunch and participate in water activities like swimming, kayaking and paddleboarding.</p>

		<h5>Multi-Day Channel Islands Sailing Charter Experience</h5>
		<p>Crossing the Santa Barbara Channel to Santa Cruz Island takes 4-7 hours depending on wind, sea conditions and island(s) to be visited. Explore one island by land and sea or visit several of the Channel Islands.</p>
