<!--          <h5 class="my-3">Experience the Enchantment</h5>-->
          <p>Depending upon the season, the Channel Islands offer some of the most spectacular surfing in the world. However, due to the nature of the surf culture, ever changing weather conditions and the fragile nature of the Channel Islands National Park and National Marine Sanctuary, the surfing adventures offered through Shoreline Summit Adventures are limited.</p>
          
          	<p>We attempt to honor the culture and the environment by having a few trips with limited passengers (3-6) who can participate in a way that is consistent with the sport and the islands.</p>

		  <h5>Weather</h5>
		  
		  <p>Surfers should be prepared for a variety of weather conditions, especially on the outer islands. Thirty-knot winds are not uncommon on Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands. Sturdy, low-profile tents, stakes and line for securing tents to ground, table or wind shelters are recommended.</p>
		  
		  <p>Fog can occur on the islands during any season producing cool, damp conditions.</p>
		  
		<p>It’s advisable to check weather conditions before departing in order to get a sense of what to expect while on the islands.</p>

		  <h5>Planning Your Trip</h5>
		<p>Surfing is a unique and rewarding way to experience the pristine marine environment of Channel Islands National Park. You will find solitude and splendor on these self-guided adventures. This location is a world class destination for surfing because of easy beach access, clear ocean waters, nearby camping, readily available boat transportation service and a spectacular shoreline with beautiful sea cave and cliffs to explore. Surfing is available year-round for day visits and camping trips.</p>

		<p>Surfing at San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands is recommended for more experienced, skilled and well-conditioned surfers with all necessary safety equipment due to the consistently extreme weather and sea conditions that regularly dominate these areas.</p>

		<p>Shoreline Summit Adventures philosophy is consistent with the mission of the Surfrider Foundation which is represented by over 50,000 members and approximately 80 local chapters in the U.S. as well as affiliations in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Europe and Japan. The Surfrider Foundation is a non-profit environmental organization dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of the world’s oceans, waves and beaches for all people, through conservation, activism, research and education.</p>
        
        <p>While the surf culture didn’t originate in southern California, it is worth noting the Beach Boys who popularized the sport and lifestyle are from Santa Barbara where Shoreline Summit Adventures is based. Surfing is limited by the coast, the swells, the number of surfers and so on. Localism or territorialism is a part of the development of surf culture in which individuals or groups of surfers designate certain key surfing spots as their own. This is the nature of the sport (it doesn’t make sense to fight nature) despite the fact that taxpayers fund the Channel Island National Park and may feel entitled to unlimited access. It is worth noting the old saying about “when in Rome, do as the Romans do.” There is access for adventure travelers as well as locals as long as those visiting respect the sport’s culture and the local “rules of the road.”</p>

          <h5>Shoreline Summit Adventures Honors the Surfrider Foundation Principles:</h5>
		</div>
		  <div class="col-md-10">
		  	<ul>
			<li>Surfrider recognizes the biodiversity and ecological integrity of the planet’s coasts are necessary and irreplaceable. Surfrider is committed to preserving natural living and non-living diversity and ecological integrity of the coastal environment</li>
    		<li>Surfrider promotes the right of low-impact, free and open access to the world’s waves and beaches for all people. Surfrider acts to preserve this right of access</li>
    		<li>Surfrider is dedicated to enhancing wave-riding opportunities in ways which will not adversely impact near-shore ecosystems</li>
    		<li>Surfrider believes environmental education is essential to the future health and well- being of the planet. Surfrider seeks to develop and utilize educational materials that are informative, factual, proactive, synergistic and fun</li>
    		<li>Surfrider strives to be accurate and nonpartisan in its communications with its members and the general public. In addition, Surfrider will express the unique values inherent in wave-riding – individualism, camaraderie, non-materialism, and an appreciation for human kind’s historic relations with the ocean</li>
    		<li>Surfrider is a grassroots organization, effective through the participation of its members. Surfrider activities emphasize the value of an involved membership</li>
            <li>Surfrider encourages all commercial enterprises to adopt the Ceres Principles. Their determination to do so will favorably influence Surfrider’s willingness to provide support. Surfrider will not permit sponsors to divert the Foundation from its mission or projects undertaken</li>
            <li>Surfrider does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sex or national origin for any reason. Surfrider promotes the healthy enjoyment of the coastal environment for all people</li>
            <li>Surfrider and its representatives, affiliations and chapters agree to abide by these principles and all rules and regulations governing non-profit organizations</li>

			<h5>Safety:</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-10">
		  	<ul>
		Please follow these saftey regulations:		
    	<li>Use the “buddy system.” There are no lifeguards on duty. Kayaking is at your own risk. Stay together and paddle within the skills of the least experienced paddler in the group.</li>
    	<li>Obtain current weather and sea conditions. The conditions around the islands are considered “open ocean.” Extreme weather conditions may be encountered at any time and sea conditions may become dangerous without warning. There is no place where visitors will be kayaking in a protected cove. Always observe and evaluate sea conditions before entering the water. Be alert to wind, wave, and currents at all times.</li>
    	<li>Do not travel downwind (with the wind) as you will have to return into a headwind. Wind and waves typically come out of the northwest or west. Winds tend to increase in the afternoon. Morning hours can be a better time for kayaking and other watersports. Challenging Santa Ana or east winds may occur at any time, but are most common from September through April.</li>
    	<li>Do not exceed your skill level. If you are new to sea kayaking or other watersports, stay close to your launch area and paddle with an experienced kayaker. Ask National Park Service personnel or kayak guides if you have questions concerning weather, safety, etc. Be capable of re-entering your kayak from the water.</li>
    	<li>Let someone know where you are going and when you expect to return. Kayakers should always file a “float plan” with family and/or friends and inform them of your departure and return. The float plan should include: 1) the number of boats and boaters on the trip as well as the color, size and type of craft used; 2) names and addresses for the boaters as well as emergency phone numbers; 3) any survival and special emergency equipment should be listed (EPIRB, VHF, food rations, flares, etc.); and 4) the place, date and time of departure and return should be logged as well as destination(s). This information can be invaluable for a search operation if something goes wrong. Remember to be flexible with your plans. Weather should always determine your course of action.</li>
    	<li>Carefully select and equip your paddle craft. Craft should be of a sea kayak design and kayakers must have the following: 1) lifejackets-all paddlers must have lifejackets; 2) helmets should always be worn when paddling below cliffs and in sea caves; 3) VHF radio, tow line, compass, throw bag, first aid kit, signaling device (air horn, whistle or signal mirror) and make sure you know how to use them; and 4) wetsuits are highly recommended since water temperatures remain cold throughout the year.</li>

          <h5>Landing Permits and Procedures</h5>
		<p>There are no landing permits required for the islands administered by the National Park Service. Please note that rocks or islets on or near any of the islands are closed year-round to any landing and pets are not allowed in the park. There are closed and restricted areas on each island. Kayakers may land according to the following procedures:</p>
        <div class="col-md-10">
		  	<ul>
        <li><b>Anacapa Island</b> - A permit is not required to land or hike on East Anacapa Island or at Frenchy’s Cove. West Anacapa (except Frenchy’s Cove) is a protected research natural area and is closed to visitors. Visitors are allowed on Middle Anacapa by permit only and when accompanied by a park ranger.</li>
    	<li><b>San Miguel Island</b> - Kayakers may land only on the beach at Cuyler Harbor. Visitors may walk the beach at Cuyler Harbor and hike up Nidever Canyon to the ranger station. To hike beyond the ranger station, visitors must be escorted by a ranger and have a permit. </li>
    	<li><b>Santa Barbara Island</b> - A permit is not required to land or hike on Santa Barbara Island. Access to the island is permitted only at the landing cove. The landing dock is available for unloading purposes only. No craft, including kayaks and inflatables, should be left moored to the dock.</li>
    	<li><b>Santa Cruz Island</b> - Boaters may land and hike on the eastern 24% of Santa Cruz Island without a permit. This area is owned by the National Park Service and is east of the property line between Prisoners Harbor and Valley Anchorage. Due to surf and swell conditions, boaters should use extreme caution when making surf-landings at any beach, especially Smugglers Cove and those beaches facing south and southeast between San Pedro Point and Sandstone Point. A landing permit, however, is required to land on Nature Conservancy property which manages the western 76% of Santa Cruz Island. A fee is charged and no overnight island use is permitted. Allow 10-12 days for processing.</li>
    	<li><b>Santa Rosa Island</b> - Boaters may land along coastline and on beaches without a permit for day-use only. From March 1 to September 15, the back beaches and sand dunes between and including Skunk Point to just north of East Point are closed to hiking to protect the nesting area for the snowy plover, a federally listed, threatened shorebird. Please remain on the wet sand (below mean high tide) or the road throughout this area. The beaches around Sandy Point are closed year-round. A pier is available at Becher’s Bay.</li>
